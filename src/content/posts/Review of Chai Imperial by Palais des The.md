# Review of Chaï Impérial by Palais des Thés

![](771-34801-v9p8uywm6p-removebg-preview.png)

I recently tried Chaï Impérial, a masala chai blend from Palais des Thés. Here's my detailed review of the experience:

Preparation:

- **Temperature:** 212°F / 100°C
- **Time:** 3 min, 0 sec
- **Tea Amount:** 7 g
- **Water Volume:** 14 oz / 400 ml

## Overview

What a great Masala Chai, paired with milk (50:50 ratio) this is definitely one of the best ones out there.

### Tasting Notes:

Nothing much to add, the cardamom and ginger overpower the pink pepper, but that is to be expected from a Masala chai. I made myself some Karak Chai with it too using concentrated milk.

Flavors: Cardamom, Ginger

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 25/30 - Rich and well-balanced spices, although cardamom and ginger dominate.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 18/20 - Performs well even with minor adjustments in preparation.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 20/20 - Maintains strong flavor profile throughout.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 19/30 - Highly enjoyable, particularly with milk.

# 82/100
