# Review of Pu Erh Lin Cang BIO by Palais des Thés

I recently tried Pu Erh Lin Cang BIO, a tea from Palais des Thés. Here's my detailed review of the experience:

## Overview

This is my first pu'er tea, and maybe my last dark pu'er for a while. I'm still new to tea, and this one is a bit challenging for me. While the earthiness wasn’t too strong and I could distinctly sense the typical pu'er aroma, I admit it’s just too out there for me. However, it's an overall good tea that needs to be tried.

## Preparation

- **Temperature:** 205°F / 96°C
- **Steeping Time:** 0 min, 30 sec
- **Tea Amount:** 4 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 mL

## Tasting Experience

I brewed it with 30-second steeps, using 4g of tea per 100mL of water. The experience was okay, but it didn't quite match my taste preferences.

## Flavor Profile

The tea has a strong earthy flavor and a viscous texture, which are typical characteristics of pu'er tea. While some may enjoy these qualities, I found them to be too intense for my liking.

Flavors: Earthy, Viscous

#### My recommendation: Recommended for those who enjoy bold, earthy flavors in their tea.

## Rating:
# 60/100
