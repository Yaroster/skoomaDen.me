Butterfly of Taiwan is a honey-like, sweet tea that offers a balanced and pleasant experience. Despite being on the lighter end, it provides a good equilibrium of flavors, making it one of the best offerings from PDT.

### Steepings

Honey-like, sweet.

Overbrewed it but it’s still very good.

#### 3rd Steep (205°F / 96°C, 15s)

Nice good equilibrium on the top, very round taste, definitely one of the best offerings from PDT.
