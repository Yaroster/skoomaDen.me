Later this month, I'm probably gonna recieve my w2t samples to try and review here !

But before that, I just couldn't wait to get more tea.
So I bought myself some samples from Palais Des Thés.

Now I was pretty inflamatory about Palais Des Thés for what I believe are valid points about their quality. Very perfumy teas, very bland tasting too, I do not believe I have rated a single one of them anything more than a 65.

That being said, their new tea samples really cought my eye, see they don't usually sell any teas under 50g, a costly and often wasteful measure that makes it very difficult to try their teas if you don't cough up the money for a bag or a teaset (that often cost 2.5$/g lol).

Their new tea samples are around $3 per pack, these packs are small tin boxes with tea samples that contain no more than 6g, and that often contain 4g.

I bought a bunch, because the teashop owner just knows how to talk to me, and there I went.

Not only that, but I got myself a new tea boat (the previous one was just too small, and It took a while to clean too. This is gonna be much more straight forward !)

Alright, you guys get ready for a new review of the Milky Oolong by Palais des Thés !
Stay tuned !
