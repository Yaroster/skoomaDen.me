description: "Review of a mysterious White Pu Erh Brick"
---

I recently discovered a tea curiosity labeled as "White Pu Erh Brick." The packaging was minimalist, almost bare, with the brick itself resembling a chocolate bar, each "bar" weighing 30g. Intrigued, I spent nearly 20 Euros for a 150g total.

## Preparation

- **Temperature:** 95°C
- **First Steep:** 10 sec
- **Tea Amount:** 30 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 ml

## Overview

Initially, the concept of a White Pu Erh was... shocking to say the least. It's definitely quite unconventional. My first infusion revealed a stark peach-colored soup.

### Flavor Profile

The tea's clarity in appearance paralleled its taste—crisp, rounded, devoid of any bitterness or typical earthy notes expected in traditional Pu Erh. Surprisingly, it possessed the delicate characteristics of white tea but none of the expected Pu Erh flavors. Quite misleading...

### Overall Impression

This White Pu Erh Brick defied my expectations, offering one of the most fulfilling and stable white tea experiences. It was refreshingly straightforward and lacked the earthiness of a typical Pu Erh, making it an excellent choice for those seeking a pure and gentle tea. It's vastly superior to the Bai Mu Dan offerings from Palais des Thés, which I will soon review.

## Tasting Experiences

The subtlety of the flavor profile ensures that the taste does not linger excessively, making it an ideal companion to meals. Its light yet noticeably caffeinated nature suggests it could serve as an excellent morning tea.

Given the price of about 10 Euros online for 150g, this tea offers exceptional value for money.

Flavors: Clear, Round, Delicate

#### My recommendation: Highly recommended for its unique character and excellent value.

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 27/30 - Exceptional clarity and subtlety, well-rounded.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 18/20 - Maintains its delicate profile across multiple steeps.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 20/20 - Surprisingly consistent and stable flavor.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 25/30 - Highly enjoyable, especially for those seeking a gentle, refreshing tea.
