## About legitimacy...

Before anything, I would like to clarify certain points and biases I have concerning these books for transparency.

My knowledge of Chinese internal affairs is much more limited than my direct experiences with their foreign policies, a trait that these two authors certainly do not share with me as they are both experts in their fields and have dealt with Chinese affairs for quite a long time.

My approach for this critique will be both from the point of view of a passionate man who does his best to stay informed and opinionated about current affairs and from the point of view of someone with direct experience with China's foreign institutions and their efforts to, in the words of current General Secretary [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping), "open China's doors wider" [(19th National Congress speech)](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/special/19cpcnc/documents.htm).

This is, thusly, both an opinion piece and a joint critique of both [Kerry Brown](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/kerry-brown)'s [Xi: A Study in Power](https://www.amazon.com/Xi-Study-Power/dp/1785788086) and [Elizabeth C. Economy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy)'s [The Third Revolution: Xi Jinping and the New Chinese State](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071). I will directly compare both books on specific points before giving my opinion about them. Both Dr. Brown and Dr. Economy's points of view seem to, more often than not, draw a contrasted overall image of the same truth, which will be of much use to express my own opinions comparatively.



## Leadership and Power

Dr. Brown portrays [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) as a leader deeply focused on consolidating power within the [CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China) and across China. He describes Xi as the most powerful leader since Mao, putting emphasis on the techniques employed to maintain loyalty within the Party:

> "Xi Jinping has not just accumulated more power than any Chinese leader since Mao, he has also done it more quickly and with greater assurance of his own leadership."
 (<mark>Xi: A Study in Power</mark>, p. 38).

Brown argues that Xi's ability to create sustainable power is a mix of both strategic appointments within the Party and building a cult-like influence, using the anti-corruption campaign almost exclusively as a means to destroy opposition.

This very line of thought, however, is what his contemporary Dr. Economy strictly refutes in her [presentation at Victoria University Wellington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnBBJ6dXsu4&list=LL&index=1).

> "People often ask if Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign is really just a mechanism for him to eliminate his political enemies or if it is legitimate, and I think it's clearly both... Xi Jinping does not have 620,000 political enemies; this is a legitimate effort to clean up the Communist Party."​  (<mark>[Economy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy)</mark>, 2019).

**My thoughts:** [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) has continuously used the metaphor of a relay race, a predecessor must prepare the baton properly before passing it to another. [Xi Jinping Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping_Thought) is, then, simply the logical continuation of what [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping) and [Hu Jintao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao) have built before him. They both didn't succeed, of course, in completing [Socialism with Chinese Characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics). However, Xi does credit them in the first volume of [The Governance of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governance_of_China) as both proper carriers of this metaphorical baton.

While the narrative that was built could be questioned, Dr. Economy herself argues that she doesn't believe we are currently seeing the formation of a life-long one-man rule:

> "He can now hold the three most important positions—General Secretary of the Communist Party, President of the country, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission—for life, although I don't expect him to do that."
 (<mark>[Economy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy)</mark>, 2019).

It is my belief that Brown builds, per his deep experience with Chinese internal affairs, perhaps a too grand image of how far Xi's influence extends, with multiple unfortunate parallels with Mao. Economy, on the other hand, draws a much more nuanced picture, linking both foreign and internal affairs to build what resembles how Chinese people might actually perceive Xi's rule internally.



## Domestic Control vs. Global Ambition

Dr. Brown continues his analysis of [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) by focusing on how Xi uses his immense power to ensure the internal stability of China. Xi’s domestic policies, such as the anti-corruption campaign and his emphasis on control through the Party, are ultimately about safeguarding the [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China)’s dominance within China.

> "Xi’s consolidation of power is about ensuring that the Communist Party remains unchallenged within China, even if that comes at the cost of suppressing dissent and centralizing authority in his own hands."
 (<mark>Xi: A Study in Power</mark>, p. 45).

Brown sees Xi as prioritizing the Party's survival above all else, even at the expense of individual freedoms. The internal power dynamics of China, he argues, are fundamentally about preserving this status quo of control and preventing any disruption that could weaken the Party’s grip on power.

On the other hand, Dr. Economy focuses more on Xi’s global ambitions and how his domestic consolidation of power is a stepping stone for projecting China’s influence abroad. Xi’s policies, Economy argues, are as much about exporting China’s model as they are about preserving internal stability.

> "Xi Jinping has made it clear that his vision for China extends beyond its borders... He seeks to project the current Chinese political and economic development model globally."
 (<mark>[The Third Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071)</mark>, p. 112).

Economy highlights that Xi’s domestic control provides the foundation for his global aspirations, from initiatives like the [Belt and Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) to China's growing role in international institutions. Xi’s ambition is to redefine global norms and present China as an alternative to Western liberal democracies.

**My thoughts:** Building on my understanding of [Xi Jinping Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping_Thought) and the trajectory of his leadership, it is evident that Xi’s consolidation of power serves a dual purpose. Domestically, it ensures stability and continuity within the Communist Party, a continuation of the work started by [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping) and [Hu Jintao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao). His emphasis on unity and the centralization of authority reflects not just an effort to maintain power but to advance China’s long-term development goals, especially through [Socialism with Chinese Characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics).

From a broader perspective, Xi’s ambitions clearly extend beyond China’s borders. His global initiatives, particularly the [Belt and Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative), are not merely economic but part of a strategic effort to position China as a central player in the global order. This mirrors his domestic focus on ensuring stability by projecting strength and confidence on the world stage. While some may argue that this is part of Xi’s personal ambition, I believe it is more a reflection of the logical next step in China’s evolution as outlined by [Xi Jinping Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping_Thought).



## Reform and Continuity

Dr. Brown portrays [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) as a leader who is more focused on preserving the status quo rather than pushing for radical reform. Xi’s leadership, according to Brown, is about ensuring that the Party remains dominant while making calculated adjustments to maintain stability and power. Brown argues that Xi's so-called reforms are more about entrenching the Party's control rather than truly modernizing China.

> "Xi is not a reformer in the sense of fundamentally altering the system. His reforms are more about maintaining the Party’s grip on power and ensuring the system stays intact."
 (<mark>Xi: A Study in Power</mark>, p. 65).

Brown highlights that while Xi may speak the language of reform, his actual policies reflect a more conservative approach focused on reinforcing Party control rather than embracing substantial change. Xi’s emphasis on nationalism, loyalty, and Party ideology indicates that he is more concerned with continuity than true reform.

In contrast, Dr. Economy argues that [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping)’s leadership represents a new kind of reform. She highlights how Xi’s policies are transforming China’s internal and external landscapes, breaking from [Deng Xiaoping's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping) mantra of “keeping a low profile.” Xi’s “[Third Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071)” involves reshaping China’s domestic governance while simultaneously redefining its global role.

> "Xi’s Third Revolution represents a significant break from the past... He seeks to create a more assertive and expansive China, one that is increasingly authoritarian at home but also more engaged in shaping the global order."
 (<mark>[The Third Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071)</mark>, p. 150).

Economy argues that Xi’s reforms are aimed at creating a stronger, more centralized state that can compete on the global stage. While his policies may reinforce Party control domestically, they also reflect a broader vision for China’s role in the world. Xi’s willingness to reshape governance, the economy, and foreign policy marks a departure from the incrementalism of his predecessors.

**My thoughts:** [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping)’s leadership seems to balance both reform and continuity. While his policies do reinforce the Party’s control, I believe that they are also laying the groundwork for long-term structural changes that align with [Socialism with Chinese Characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics). His emphasis on economic modernization and technological innovation indicates that Xi is pushing for reform in key areas that will secure China’s place as a global power. 

That said, Xi’s reforms are not about democratization or liberalization but about strengthening China’s system in a way that supports the Party’s continued dominance. This is why I find Economy’s interpretation of Xi’s “[Third Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071)” compelling—she highlights that these changes are significant, even if they do not align with Western concepts of reform. The reforms may be authoritarian in nature, but they reflect a pragmatic approach to governance that positions China for the future.



## Economic Strategy and Global Role

Dr. Brown sees [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping)'s economic strategy as being primarily about ensuring domestic stability rather than pursuing global ambitions. Brown suggests that Xi uses China's economic growth as a tool for maintaining internal control, viewing economic strength as a means of legitimizing the Party's rule and placating potential dissent.

> "Xi’s economic policies are focused more on securing domestic stability than on driving global change. He uses China’s economic growth to maintain the Party’s legitimacy and ensure that internal threats to stability are minimized."
 (<mark>Xi: A Study in Power</mark>, p. 88).

Brown argues that while China’s economic rise is significant, Xi’s policies are designed to ensure that this growth reinforces the Party’s dominance. The emphasis is on managing internal risks, preventing economic crises, and using state control to guide development in a way that secures political stability.

Dr. Economy, on the other hand, emphasizes that [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping)’s economic strategy is part of a broader effort to project China’s power globally. She argues that initiatives like the [Belt and Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) are not just about economic expansion but about reshaping global norms and extending China’s influence in key regions.

> "The Belt and Road Initiative is emblematic of Xi’s broader vision for China’s economic power... It is a tool for extending Chinese influence globally, reshaping the rules of the game, and positioning China as a global leader."
 (<mark>[The Third Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071)</mark>, p. 203).

Economy highlights that Xi’s economic strategy is deeply tied to his global ambitions. The [Belt and Road Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative), for instance, is not just an infrastructure project but a means of exporting Chinese political and economic norms. This reflects Xi’s goal of positioning China as a leader in the international order, particularly in regions where Western influence is waning.

**My thoughts:** Xi’s economic strategy appears to be multifaceted. On one hand, it undeniably serves to stabilize China domestically, ensuring that the Party remains in control and that economic growth can be sustained. On the other hand, initiatives like the [Belt and Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) clearly demonstrate China’s ambition to extend its influence globally. I believe Xi’s economic strategy is a careful balancing act—one that secures domestic stability while also pushing China to the forefront of the global economy.

Xi’s vision is not just about growing China’s economy but about positioning China as an alternative to the Western-led economic order. This is evident in how China is using its economic strength to create new alliances, develop infrastructure across emerging economies, and expand its political reach. While Brown may downplay the global significance of Xi’s economic policies, I agree with Economy that these policies are integral to Xi’s broader global ambitions.



## Conclusion

Both [Kerry Brown](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/kerry-brown)’s <mark>[Xi: A Study in Power](https://www.amazon.com/Xi-Study-Power/dp/1785788086)</mark> and [Elizabeth Economy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy)’s <mark>[The Third Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071)</mark> offer valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping)’s leadership. Brown provides a detailed analysis of Xi’s efforts to consolidate power within China, portraying him as a leader focused primarily on internal stability and maintaining the Party’s dominance. His work highlights the more conservative aspects of Xi’s leadership, emphasizing continuity over radical reform.

<mark>In contrast, Economy’s analysis presents Xi as a transformative figure</mark>, whose leadership extends beyond China’s borders. Her depiction of Xi’s “[Third Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071)” showcases his ambition to reshape the global order, using both economic and political power to export China’s model and influence international norDr. Economy’s work underscores Xi’s role as a global strategist, one who is redefining China’s place in the world.

<mark>Ultimately</mark>, I believe both [Brown](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/kerry-brown) and [Economy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy) capture essential aspects of [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping)’s leadership. Brown’s focus on domestic control highlights the importance of stability and continuity in Xi’s approach, while Economy’s emphasis on global ambition reflects the broader significance of Xi’s policies on the world stage. Xi’s leadership is about balancing these two forces—ensuring that China remains stable and powerful at home while positioning it as a global leader.

From my perspective, <mark>[Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) represents a continuation of China’s historical trajectory</mark>, blending both reform and continuity. His focus on stability and centralization reflects a deep understanding of China’s political needs, while his global ambitions push China toward a more assertive role in the international order. Both [Brown](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/kerry-brown) and [Economy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy) offer insightful analyses, and their work helps to paint a more complete picture of <mark>[Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping)’s complex and dynamic leadership.</mark>


P.S: It is my belief that, while both authors are experts on the question of Chinese policy, they certainly are very US foreign policy centric.
It would most definitely be a refreshing experience to see these authors break the mold and taking a more independant stance, this is especially true for [Dr. Economy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/elizabeth-economy)'s Third Revolution.
