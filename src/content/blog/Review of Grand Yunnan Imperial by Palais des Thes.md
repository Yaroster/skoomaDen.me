I recently tried Grand Yunnan Impérial, a black tea from Palais des Thés. Here's my detailed review of the experience:

Preparation:

- **Temperature:** 205°F / 96°C
- **Time:** 0 min, 15 sec
- **Tea Amount:** 5 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 ml

## Overview

After a disappointing initial attempt with a steep time of 45 seconds resulting in strong bitterness, I decided to switch to Gong Fu style brewing to explore the tea's potential further.

### First Infusion (10s)

For the first infusion, I steeped the tea for about 10 seconds, aiming to quickly extract the flavor without letting it become bitter.

### Second Infusion (15s)

The second infusion was very relaxing, with the expected bitterness for a black tea. However, it didn't exhibit any outstanding characteristics beyond being a standard Yunnan black tea.

### Third Infusion (10s)

The third infusion revealed the tea's potential as the bitterness subsided, leaving a lighter and more enjoyable experience. This infusion was particularly praised.

### Fourth Infusion (25s)

With the fourth infusion, the bitterness became more pronounced, but no significant difference was noted compared to the third infusion.

## Overall Impression 

In conclusion, Grand Yunnan Impérial proved to be a non-exceptional yet pleasant black tea. It exhibited slightly less bitterness than expected, making it suitable for casual consumption.

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 12/30 - Some enjoyable moments but lacks distinctive or exceptional flavors.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 15/20 - Not particularly forgiving, shorter steeps are more successful.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 15/20 - Variations in experience across infusions, some inconsistency.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 13/30 - Pleasant but not memorable or impressive.

# 55/100
