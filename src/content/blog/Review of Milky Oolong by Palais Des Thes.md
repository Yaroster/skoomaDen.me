I recently got myself lots of [samples](https://skoomaden.me/posts/new-palais-des-thes-samples-/) from Palais des Thés.

## Preparation

- **Temperature:** 194°F / 90°C
- **Time:** 15s, 20s, 25s, 30s
- **Tea Amount:** 4 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 mL

## Overview

This tea is really good and light. I definitely get where the “milky” comes from; this is a very creamy and round tea with a light sweetness at the bottom that I have trouble identifying accurately for now. Overall, very tasty, and I'm glad I drank the wash for this one.

### Steepings

#### 1st Steep (194°F / 90°C, 15s)

This is really good and light. The “milky” aspect is very pronounced, providing a creamy and round tea with light sweetness. 

#### 2nd Steep (194°F / 90°C, 20s)

It’s definitely subtle, although I did have a smaller sample size. It’s very light and pleasant, the perfect balance. This is probably on the less oxidized side of oolongs and definitely has some young puer notes.

#### 3rd Steep (194°F / 90°C, 25s)

The tea evolves a bit, and I’m getting smoked hazelnuts. Other than that, it’s just a very correct milky oolong, likely a solid representation of what a generic one would taste like.

#### 4th Steep (194°F / 90°C, 30s)

No particular change in taste. Knowing I probably understeeped the tea, I don’t think there’s any point in going any further.

## Overall Impression

Great tea overall. 

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 10/30 – What it lacks in complexity, the tea gains in balance; it’s on the lighter end.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 15/20 – Seemed to take my 194°F / 90°C (and sometimes a bit under) pretty well!
- **Quality Across Infusions:** 20/20 – Definitely high quality and very consistent too.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 15/30 – I liked this. It’s a good session, nothing more, nothing less.

# 60/100
