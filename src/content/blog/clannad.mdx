# Clannad: Melancholy, Illusions, and Wishes

Empty, otherworldly, an ever-extending landscape and a lonesome girl creating a body from parts of junk. It's a robot, a small robot. This world runs in parallel to this one, right? There it is: it's the connection. It's progressing, as the story goes it's progressing, this always-static story finally begins to move.

The town, it's a person, it grants wishes. Places hold emotions, the ones of those who lived. The light, the float, just like we were told they would, they float after we started wishing for movement, they float so we can keep walking.

Through its *esoteric* and often *abstract* narrative elements, this story encourages its viewers to reflect on their actions, to let themselves be defined by nothing more than their *wishes*, it's deeply contemplative.

Our talk today will be about a [visual novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) that deeply affected me, so sit back, relax, this will be a long one because today, we're talking about [Clannad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/324160/CLANNAD/).

**_[N.B: If you have not watched Clannad yet, I strongly recommend you do before going any further!_**

## An Introduction

Clannad is a visual novel developed by [Key Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(company)), renowned for creating the early 2000s hit games [Kanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanon_(visual_novel)) and [Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_(video_game)).

Released on Windows, PSP, PS2, PS3, PS4, PSVita, Switch, [FOMAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Mobile_Multimedia_Access), Android, and basically anything that had a screen during that time.

With four manga adaptations, two anime seasons, and two games, including [Clannad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/324160/CLANNAD/) and [Clannad Side Stories](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420100/CLANNAD_Side_Stories/) released in 2008, it follows a classic dramatic/romance high school narrative with esoteric twists that set it apart, promising a deeper exploration of its themes later in this discussion.

The story unfolds across six main plot lines, beginning at [Hikarizaka Private High School](https://clannad.fandom.com/wiki/Hikarizaka_Private_High_School) and transitioning to broader settings within the same city—a narrative shift too significant to reveal prematurely.

We step into the shoes of [Tomoya Okazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Clannad_characters#Tomoya_Okazaki), although he is viewed as a delinquent by his classmates, he really is a straightforward and loyal friend, fully dedicating himself to those around him in times of need.

Disclaimer: While I have played through the original game on both PC and Switch, my closest and fondest memories with this franchise have been with the anime adaptation, which will be the reference material for today's article, I might thusly be biased towards the adaptation.

## But I don't have any more tears left in me!

**_[MASSIVE SPOILERS, ALT+F4 NOW IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH CLANNAD YET, I'M SERIOUS]_**

Tomoya's journey in Clannad After Story starts with a heavy burden. He struggles to reconcile with his own father while attempting to be a better parent to Ushio, his daughter, who's now without her mom. But there's a twist: Tomoya hasn't forgiven Ushio for what he sees as her role in his lover's untimely death during childbirth. This resentment sparks a powerful dialogue about parenting that crescendos in Clannad After Story. As the story unfolds, themes of forgiveness, healing, and grief take center stage, guiding Tomoya towards a crucial realization. Ultimately, he chooses to break free from the grip of his pain and embrace a new chapter of his life.

Growth... is the key word here. Tomoya’s arc is a poignant portrayal of personal growth and redemption because _it's catalyzed by his relationships, particularly with Nagisa. Shared experiences, Tomoya the value of responsibility, sincere effort, and support, those aren't things you learn easily._ His transformation from a listless adolescent to a committed father and husband underscores this very theme, he gets it through **pain and devotion**.

![Tomoya Sad GIF](https://animesher.com/orig/0/80/804/8048/animesher.com_family-sad-tomoya-804863.gif)

The emotional power of Clannad is rooted in its authentic portrayal of life’s highs and lows, making it a series that frequently moves viewers to tears, it doesn't shy away from important and deep subjects that simply cannot be talked about without going through moments of both normality and hardships.

This combination of relatable storytelling, deep emotional themes, and strong character development, all beautifully underscored by its artistic elements, to connect with viewers on a profoundly emotional level. **_And believe me, Tomoya’s arc was only an example._**

## An image, and some music, are worth a thousand words.

The soundtrack of Clannad, composed by the acclaimed [Jun Maeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun_Maeda) along with other artists, plays a crucial role in setting the emotional tone of the anime. From "[Dango Daikazoku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfgyKPQO9g8)," a simple melody that becomes a recurring leitmotif associated with the central themes of family and connection, to ["Town, Flow of Time, People"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KMzDVf2Bx4&ab_channel=BenBooze), an invitation to getting lost in the illusionary world, this series' OST subtly reinforces the emotional and thematic undertones of various scenes without ever overpowering them.

The visual and musical elements of Clannad are laden with symbolism that aligns with its *esoteric* themes. The series uses visual cues like the floating orbs of light—*symbolic of wishes and emotional fulfillment*—to visually represent the impact of the characters' actions and emotional states. These orbs, and the scenes in which they appear, are crafted to visually manifest the series' exploration of *wishes*, *happiness*, and the *metaphysical connections* between characters and their environment.

The interplay of light and shadow, the seasons depicted in the backdrop, and the transitions from the real world to the *Illusionary World* are all portrayed with a keen attention to detail, reinforcing the narrative’s exploration of themes like alternate realities and the thin veil between the tangible and the spiritual.

## The Illusionary World

This metaphysical space serves as a symbolic counterpoint to the real-world experiences of the main characters, particularly Tomoya and Ushio. It functions as a realm where existential themes—such as the nature of existence, the impact of choices, and the concept of *wishes and miracles*—are deeply explored.

The Illusionary World is depicted as a stark, almost desolate landscape, inhabited only by a mysterious Girl and a Garbage Doll. This world is starkly different from the vibrant and emotional landscape of the real world, characterized by its minimalistic visual style and the absence of conventional life forms. The existence of this world within the broader narrative of Clannad suggests a layer of reality that operates under different rules, one where time and conventional physics do not seem to apply. This setting allows for a deeper exploration of themes like *fate*, *destiny*, and the *cyclical nature of life*.

The Illusionary World's events often parallel or foreshadow occurrences in the real world, particularly those involving Tomoya and his family. The creation of the body in the Illusionary World, for instance, can be seen as a metaphor for the emotional and psychological rebuilding that Tomoya undergoes following personal tragedies, including his fraught relationships and the challenges of fatherhood.

As the series progresses towards its conclusion, the interactions between the Illusionary and real worlds become more pronounced. The Illusionary World is revealed to be not just a passive reflection of the real world but an active participant in the fate of its characters. The resolution of the anime hinges on the events in this metaphysical space, where the accumulation of light orbs—*symbolic representations of emotional fulfillment and resolved conflicts*—facilitates a wish-granting miracle that profoundly impacts the characters' lives.

Through the Illusionary World, Clannad articulates a sophisticated narrative about life's *intangible aspects*, using this metaphysical dimension to enrich the story’s emotional and philosophical undertones, making it a unique and profound exploration of life's deeper meanings.

## Town, Flow of Time, People

The town itself transcends its role as a mere setting, evolving into an almost living entity with profound connections to the series' characters and their journeys. This *esoteric* quality of the town is closely tied to its ability to grant wishes, a concept deeply woven into the folklore of the narrative.

![Clannad Locations](https://oveldashome.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/clannad-ep5-2.png?w=1024)

It has a mystical presence that impacts the lives of its inhabitants. This is particularly embodied through the orbs of light that appear throughout the series. These orbs are manifestations of personal happiness and hope, emerging at key moments of emotional significance or resolution. According to the folklore within Clannad, these orbs have the power to grant wishes when collected, representing the culmination of positive emotions and resolved personal struggles.

The town's ability to affect the fates of those within it is most clearly seen in the life of Nagisa. Her health and well-being are depicted as being closely tied to the town itself. Seasons and changes in the town seem to mirror or affect her physical condition, suggesting that her life is deeply intertwined with the *esoteric nature* of the town. This link is passed on to her daughter, Ushio, who inherits her mother's deep connection to the town along with the mysterious and almost burdensome gift of influencing and being influenced by it.

## Synthesis, Reality through the lenses of Illusion

Clannad ultimately posits that life is an intricate tapestry of light and shadow, where joy cannot exist without sorrow, and meaning often comes from adversity. The relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa, and later between Tomoya and his daughter Ushio, underscores the idea that love is a powerful transformative force. It is portrayed not just as a romantic ideal but as a dynamic and sometimes difficult reality that requires resilience, sacrifice, and growth.

The series suggests that happiness is not a permanent state but a series of moments and choices. The illusionary elements, particularly the orbs of light, symbolize these fleeting yet profound experiences of joy and realization that define and enrich our existence.

Through its thoughtful integration of the real and illusionary, Clannad offers a unique perspective on the human condition, encouraging viewers to reflect on their own lives and the invisible forces that shape them. The series leaves a lasting impact by not only providing entertainment but also by inviting introspection and understanding of the deeper currents that govern our lives. This blend of storytelling elements ensures that Clannad remains as poignant as it is tear-inducing.
