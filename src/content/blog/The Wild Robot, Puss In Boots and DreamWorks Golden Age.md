## The Wild Robot, Puss in Boots & DreamWorks’ Golden Age

Some animation studios rely on a model that, although effective, leaves little room for innovation. [Disney](https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/disney-remakes-box-office-nostalgia.html), for example, has built a real nostalgia machine, capitalizing on its classic franchises by endlessly reworking them, like a record played on repeat. The formula works – it would be hard to deny – but it also reveals a certain creative caution, a reluctance to step outside the comfort zone. Disney's enchanted kingdom often resembles an impenetrable fortress, guarded by remakes and [Disney Adults](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/disney-adults-tiktok-hated-internet-1370226/).  <br><br>
But while Disney is the undisputed king of nostalgia, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) has taken a radically different approach, refusing to be confined by the classic archetypes of Western animation. From its inception, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) positioned itself as the antithesis of traditional major studios, boldly defying conventions. Far from sticking to a single formula, the studio has constantly pushed the boundaries of what an animated film can tell, exploring themes and worlds as diverse as ancient China, Viking mythology, or the underbelly of fairy tales. This is where [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) forged its own identity, as a studio capable of surprising and reinventing itself, at a time when its competitors seemed more interested in the past than the future. <br><br>

## The Antihero: Shrek  
![](image-109.png)
Shrek is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon. In 2001, while Disney continued to rely on its enchanting tales and immaculate princesses, Shrek arrived [joyfully blowing up the genre's codes](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/05/shrek-20th-anniversary-legacy-disney-1234636419/). With its anti-hero ogre, crude yet endearing, and settings filled with derision and sarcasm, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) took a direct stance against Disney. Shrek is the fairy tale's rebellion. And what makes it even more impactful is that it doesn't just mock Disney tropes; it does so while crafting a sincere and touching story, one of self-acceptance, where physical appearance no longer matters.  <br><br>
This is where we see the subtlety of [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation). Behind this irreverent surface lies a beating heart of emotion and vulnerability. The 3D, still booming at the time, is used here to enhance the characters' imperfections, not to smooth over reality. Everything in Shrek screams a break from animation standards: imperfect characters, settings that mock fairy tale castles, and humor that is far more adult than what one would have imagined at the time. This massive first success cements [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) as the studio that doesn't play by the established rules but rewrites them.  <br><br>

## Knowing How to Export: Kung Fu Panda  
![](image-110.png)
In 2008, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) took an ambitious gamble with [Kung Fu Panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda). While most Western animation studios draw on universal stories or European fairy tales, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) ventured into the unknown by choosing to set its film in China, with deep respect for its culture and traditions. It is not just an exotic setting; it is a tribute to the richness of Chinese culture and spirituality. The film draws on Taoist and Buddhist philosophies, exploring themes like the balance between body and mind, and personal growth.  <br><br>
Po, the clumsy but endearing hero, embodies this Taoist quest for Wu wei, effortless action, where self-acceptance is the key to success. [Kung Fu Panda](https://time.com/5009271/kung-fu-panda-chinese-culture/) doesn't just borrow elements from Chinese culture; it fully integrates them, both visually and philosophically. The action scenes are choreographed with precision worthy of great martial arts films, and the landscapes, inspired by traditional Chinese paintings, capture the serene beauty of this ancient civilization.  <br><br>
The film is a resounding success, not only in the United States but also in China, where it was welcomed as a respectful homage to their culture. [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation), through this film, proves that it is possible to create a work rooted in local values while being universal, an approach that clearly set the studio apart from its competitors. This was not just a commercial success; it was a true cultural bridge, a demonstration of animation's ability to transcend borders.  <br><br>

## Technique: How to Train Your Dragon 
![](image-111.png)
Two years after Kung Fu Panda, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) struck again with [How to Train Your Dragon](https://www.npr.org/2014/06/13/321281040/review-how-to-train-your-dragon-2). Here, the studio moves away from Nordic mythology clichés to offer a fresh and innovative vision of the Viking universe. Where one might have expected epic battles against bloodthirsty dragons, the film chooses to present these creatures in a different light: powerful, majestic, but misunderstood. [How to Train Your Dragon](https://www.slashfilm.com/527604/how-to-train-your-dragon-a-perfect-piece-of-animation/) reinvents the monster myth, turning it into a metaphor for acceptance of the other and the quest for identity.  <br><br>
What makes [How to Train Your Dragon](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_(film)) so memorable is not just its visuals or spectacular flying scenes — although these pushed the limits of what 3D animation could achieve at the time. No, what strikes above all is the film's emotional depth. Hiccup, the young hero, does not follow the traditional Viking hero's path; he defies expectations, those of his father, his community, and even the viewer. The film tackles universal themes: rebellion, intergenerational understanding, and, above all, the ability to change perspective in the face of the unknown.  <br><br>

## DreamWorks' Golden Age 
![](image-115.png) 
The gap left by [Pixar](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar_Animation_Studios) after the early 2010s was not just a shock to the animation industry; it was an opportunity. An opportunity that [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) seized with both bold and calculated ambition. While [Pixar](https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/the-rise-fall-and-return-of-pixar-animation/) saw its stories fall into comfortable repetition — Cars 2, Monsters University, and Finding Dory being the most symptomatic examples — [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) decided to do what Pixar was no longer doing: innovate.  <br><br>

## Stylistic Reinvention: The Last Wish
![](image-113.png)
In 2022, [Puss in Boots: The Last Wish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish) embodies this ability of [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) to not only reinvent its characters but also its artistic direction. This film is not just a simple sequel to a spin-off. It is a film that defies expectations. While Puss’s first foray was still anchored in Shrek’s irreverent tone, [The Last Wish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish) ventures into deeper visual and thematic territory. Inspired by works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film adopts an aesthetic akin to an illustrated fairy tale while remaining a high-tech product. Each scene is a tableau, with a visual texture that gives animation unprecedented depth. And this visual choice is not trivial. It serves a narrative that explores a hero's mortality who has exhausted eight of his nine lives. A bold subject for a family film, but one that fits perfectly with [DreamWorks'](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) desire to elevate its storytelling while appealing to multiple generations.  <br><br>
What [Puss in Boots: The Last Wish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish) does so remarkably is merging these new visual ambitions with emotional depth. It’s a film that doesn’t just dazzle with its style — it manages to convey ideas about fear of death, love, and friendship. In doing so, it surpasses what Pixar was still trying to do in its recent films, bringing authentic emotion without relying on already proven concepts.  <br><br>

## Introspection: The Wild Robot 
![](image-114.png)
Then there is [The Wild Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Robot), one of [DreamWorks'](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) most daring projects in years. Adapted from Peter Brown's novel, this film aims to counter the loud, saturated animation that often dominates screens. Initially conceived as a silent film – an idea unfortunately not retained due to feedback from children during test screenings – [The Wild Robot](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317222/the-wild-robot-by-peter-brown/) is a stripped-down, introspective experience that relies on the power of its visuals to convey its themes: adaptation, survival, and, above all, self-discovery. <br><br>
Far from the frenetic action scenes of Puss in Boots, [The Wild Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Robot) offers an immersion into an almost meditative world, where each interaction between Roz, the lost robot, and the local wildlife is a lesson in communication, acceptance, and difference. This staging choice, far from omnipresent dialogue and explosive special effects, shows that [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) also knows how to wield silence to create emotion. This is where the studio truly makes a difference in a landscape where animated films tend to prioritize pace over reflection.  <br><br>

## A New Direction for DreamWorks  
![](image-116.png)
[Puss in Boots: The Last Wish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish) and [The Wild Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Robot) share more than just [DreamWorks'](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) DNA. These two films embody a larger rebranding strategy for the studio, which has realized that to survive against behemoths like [Disney](https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/disney-remakes-box-office-nostalgia.html) and [Pixar](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar_Animation_Studios), it not only needed to offer something different but also something meaningful. While [Pixar](https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/the-rise-fall-and-return-of-pixar-animation/) seems to have locked itself into a dynamic of sequels and reboots, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation), with these two works, proves that it is still capable of surprising.  <br><br>
This rebranding, which plays both on visual nostalgia — with fairy tale references in [Puss in Boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish) — and narrative simplicity — with [The Wild Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Robot) — marks a real turning point. [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) no longer rests on its laurels but redefines audience expectations for animation. There is here a desire to reconnect with the very essence of animated cinema: telling stories with emotion, inventiveness, and visual relevance.  
While [Pixar](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar_Animation_Studios) continues to deliver often predictable productions, [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation), on the other hand, dares to take risks. And these risks pay off. By exploring visual and narrative styles as different yet complementary as [Puss in Boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puss_in_Boots:_The_Last_Wish) and [The Wild Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Robot), these are not just animated films, they are a statement: [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) is here to innovate, surprise, and leave a lasting mark on the cinematic landscape.  <br><br>

## Conclusion
![](image-112.png)
[DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) has carved out a place for itself, first by shocking and then by refining its bet on innovation. The question now is how far this approach can take them. For while [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) shines today through its bold visual choices and deep storytelling, the repetition of risks can also lead to saturation.  <br><br>
Animation cinema is constantly evolving, but [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) must remain vigilant. As [Pixar](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar_Animation_Studios) showed before them, constant innovation is difficult to maintain. Every film that pushes boundaries carries the threat of stagnation if this exploration becomes a formula in itself. [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) must, therefore, continue to reinvent animation but without giving in to excess.  <br><br>
The paradox [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) faces is simple: innovate while maintaining a strong narrative coherence. A delicate balance between technical mastery and narrative depth. If [DreamWorks](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation) truly wants to write a new chapter in animation, it will have to avoid the pitfalls its predecessors fell into and find the middle ground between novelty and the integrity of its identity.
