I recently tried Fleur de Sureau et Pêche Bio, a tea blend from Palais des Thés. Here's my detailed review of the experience:

## Overview

I love this tea so much! The peach is clear, and yet it does not overpower the elderflower, which is also very noticeable. It's a perfect balance of flavors.

## Preparation

- **Temperature:** 95°C
- **Time:** 2 min (initial steep), followed by consecutive 30s/1min steeps
- **Tea Amount:** 2.5 g
- **Water Volume:** A bit less than 80 mL (in my gaiwan)

## Tasting Experience

I went for an initial steep at 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by consecutive 30-second/1-minute steeps. The point here was to see how concentrated the taste could be, and it was worth it. The tea has a very subtle yet distinctive taste, making it a perfect morning brew.

## Flavor Profile

The flavors are clear, with the elderflower and peach both shining through without overpowering each other. It's a delightful blend that offers a refreshing start to the day.

Flavors: Clear, Elderflower, Peach

#### My recommendation: Highly recommended for its perfect balance of flavors and refreshing taste.

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 28/30 - Exceptional blend of flavors, well-balanced.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 18/20 - Performs well even with varying steep times.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 18/20 - Maintains flavor profile through multiple steeps, though slightly fades.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 21/30 - Highly enjoyable, though slightly lacking in intensity over time.

# 85/100
