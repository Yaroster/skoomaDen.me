I recently tried Thé du Hammam, a tea blend from Palais des Thés. Here's my detailed review of the experience:

## Preparation

- **Temperature:** 170°F / 76°C
- **Time:** 3 min, 15 sec
- **Tea Amount:** 2 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 ml

## Overview

Thé du Hammam was quite a shocker for me. My experience doesn’t seem to fit what I expected. It’s sweet and subtle, both traits that are important for a tea that describes itself as inspired by oriental hammam's scents.

### Flavor Profile

Here’s my issue, out of the four elements of the tea, only two seem to be noticeable, with one overpowering the other: the green date (notable in the aftertaste) and the rose (subtle at the front of the taste). The green date is something I never expected in a tea, providing a very refreshing form of sweetness, while the rose adds a nice touch for that Hammam-like taste. However, I didn't detect any signs of orange flower water or red fruits.

### Overall Impression

This is a recurring theme in Palais des Thés flavored teas; they tend to be too perfumy, lacking much-needed substance. While some of their recipes hit the mark, this one falls short in delivering a well-balanced flavor profile.

## Tasting Experiences

I have tried this tea twice, once in a gaiwan with 30-second steeps at 75°C and 2.5g/100ml, and once in a teapot with 6g/300ml, 75°C, steeped for 3 minutes. Unfortunately, both experiences have been disappointing so far.

I am sad because I deeply wanted to love this tea, but for Palais des Thés teas, I think I’ll just stick to their pure teas.

Flavors: Dates, Rose

#### My recommendation: Not recommended due to its lack of balance and underwhelming flavor profile.

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 10/30 - Limited complexity, with dominant but unbalanced flavors.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 10/20 - Sensitive to brewing parameters, easily becomes perfumy.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 8/20 - Fails to maintain a consistent flavor profile.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 8/30 - Disappointing and not enjoyable overall.

# 36/100
