## Preparation

- **Temperature:** 175°F / 79°C
- **Time:** 3 min, 0 sec
- **Tea Amount:** 4 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 ml

## Overview

For this tasting, I experimented with a gaiwan and utilized a somewhat unconventional brewing method: 79°C water temperature, 4g of tea per 100ml of water, steeped for 3 minutes for the initial steep, followed by constant 10-second steeps.

### Second Steep

The second steep revealed plenty of jasmine notes upfront, accompanied by a strong clove-like taste and some floral notes. Unfortunately, the experience was marred by an incredibly bitter aftertaste.

### Third, Fourth, and Subsequent Steeps

As I continued steeping, the floral notes became more pronounced, with the jasmine dominating completely and leaving no room for any other aroma.

## Overall Impression

Despite the bitterness in the second steep, I found the blend to be quite enjoyable overall. The complexity of flavors, particularly in the second steep, was remarkable and not something encountered in most teas. While the unconventional brewing method may have contributed to the bitterness, I believe that proper gongfu style brewing could yield better results.

#### My recommendation: Recommended for its complexity and pleasant flavors, especially when brewed with care.

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 18/30 - Rich in jasmine and clove notes but overly dominated by jasmine in later steeps.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 10/20 - Requires careful brewing to avoid bitterness.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 12/20 - Maintains a strong flavor profile, but bitterness impacts enjoyment.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 15/30 - Enjoyable despite the challenges in brewing, but not exceptional.
