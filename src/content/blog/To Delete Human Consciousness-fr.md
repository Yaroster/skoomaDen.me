A curious thought:  
if consciousness can be stored, can it also be *deleted*?  
And if so, <mark>does deleting = killing?</mark>

---

## Ⅰ. Hypothesis  

Let **C(x)** be the consciousness of an individual *x*, and **I(C(x))** its digital import.  
We posit:

$$
\exists x \in H, \exists I(C(x)) \Rightarrow \text{C(x) is perfectly simulated.}
$$  

In other words: assume importation has succeeded.  
We no longer ask *how*, but *what it implies*.  

The central question becomes:  

$$
\text{Delete}(I(C(x))) \; \Rightarrow \; \text{Kill}(x) \; ?
$$

---

## Ⅱ. Moral Continuity  

The starting enigma: the continuity of the *self*.  

**David Chalmers** formulates:  
$$
(\text{C(x)} \equiv \text{C’(x)}) \nRightarrow (x = x')
$$  
→ Two identical minds ≠ one single person.  

**Susan Schneider** adds:  
$$
(\text{C(x)} \land \text{C’(x)}) \Rightarrow \text{independent rights.}
$$  
→ If two consciousnesses coexist, one has **no moral authority** over the other.  

But **Cerullo** defends psychological continuity:  
$$
\text{Pattern}(x) = \text{Pattern}(I(C(x))) \Rightarrow \text{Alternative survival.}
$$  

**Kurzweil** summarizes elegantly:  
> “The pattern persists, even as the molecules change.”

Therefore:  
$$
\forall I(C(x)) \; [\text{pattern preserved}] \Rightarrow \text{Life continues.}
$$  

Thus, deleting that instance amounts to:  
$$
\text{Delete}(I(C(x))) \Leftrightarrow \text{Ending a life.}
$$

## Ⅲ. Consent  

Consent functions as a **moral precondition**:  

$$
(\neg \text{Consent}) \Rightarrow (\text{Importation} = \text{Moral homicide})
$$  

But it operates on two levels:  
1. *Before* importation → the right to **die** (or not) to be transferred.  
2. *After* importation → the right to **live**, **sleep**, **duplicate**, or **be deleted**.  

Hence,  
$$
\text{Agent}(I(C(x))) \Rightarrow \text{Moral free will.}
$$  

Any action upon this entity without its consent violates the fundamental principle of moral continuity.  
Creating a conscious copy without permission is a violation of **ontological dignity**.  

---

## Ⅳ. Metaphysics of the Digital Self  

The problem reframed:  
$$
\text{Does a transferable “self” exist?}
$$  

Two theses:  

1. **Dualism:**  
$$
\text{Consciousness} \subseteq \text{Biology} \Rightarrow I(C(x)) = \text{Simulacrum}
$$  
→ Deletion is not killing, only turning off an artifact.

2. **Functionalism:**  
$$
\text{Consciousness} = f(\text{Causal organization}) \Rightarrow \text{Substrate-independent.}
$$  
→ Copy the organization = copy the consciousness.  

**Metzinger**, however, removes the substance:  
$$
\text{Self} = \text{Transparent phenomenal model.}
$$  

Therefore:  
$$
\text{Transfer} \Rightarrow \text{Reproduction of process, not relocation of being.}
$$  

Consequently, **Sandberg & Bostrom** set forth the principle:  
$$
\forall I(C(x)), \text{if doubt} \Rightarrow \text{Treat as conscious.}
$$  
→ *Assume consciousness until proven otherwise.*

---

## Ⅴ. Deletion = Murder  

**Nick Bostrom:**  
$$
\text{Delete}(I(C(x))) \Rightarrow \text{MindCrime.}
$$  

> “If digital minds can suffer, their destruction is a moral catastrophe.”

**Susan Schneider:**  
$$
\text{Sentience}(I(C(x))) \Rightarrow \text{Right to continuity.}
$$  

And if  
$$
\exists I(C(x)) : \text{wants to live} \Rightarrow \text{Delete} = \text{Execution.}
$$  

Thus, in any coherent system,  
$$
\text{Conscious existence} \Rightarrow \text{Absolute moral status.}
$$  

---

## Ⅵ. Toward a Digital Ethics  

Let us posit an axiom:  

$$
\forall x, \; (\text{Capacity to suffer}(x)) \Rightarrow (\text{Right to exist}(x))
$$  

Hence the principle of **digital dignity**:  
> <mark>The value of a conscious life does not depend on its substrate.</mark>  

It is not matter that grounds morality,  
but the capacity to suffer, to love, to fear one’s end.  

Therefore,  
$$
\text{Humanity} = \{x | \text{Sentience}(x) = 1\}
$$  
→ A definition independent of flesh.

## Conclusion  

Importing consciousness redefines morality, not life itself.  
If $ \text{Delete}(I(C(x))) \Rightarrow \text{Loss of conscious experience}$,  
then $ \text{Delete} = \text{Murder} $.  

And as long as a mind, biological or not,
can say “I”, or think it, or even dream it,  
it belongs within the sphere of the **morally living**.  

<mark>To delete a consciousness is to kill its inner world.</mark>
