I recently got myself lots of [samples](https://skoomaden.me/posts/new-palais-des-thes-samples-/) from Palais des Thés.

This is a South Korean green tea.

## Description by Palais des Thés
Harvested in the spring on the island of Jeju, Jejudo Imperial is a green tea from Korea. Sweet and mellow,its marine and fresh hazelnut notes are typical of sejak - Korean spring teas. Well worth trying, this tea is of a very high quality.

An unusual green tea. Jejudo Impérial differs from green teas from China and Japan, with its sweetness and pronounced umamiflavour.

Compared to Japanese green teas:

More cooked notes: more well cooked vegetables, cooked fish flesh, much less fresh spinach and seaweedthan Japanese teas. The addition of minerality.More umami, very sweet.

Compared to Long Jing: Less toasted, less nutty, less minerality.

This tea is grown organically and certified by Ecocert, an accredited independent certification body.

## Preparation

- **Temperature:** 170°F / 76°C
- **Time:** 15s, 25s, 35s
- **Tea Amount:** 4 g
- **Water Volume:** 3 oz / 100 mL

## Overview

This South Korean green tea drinks like a lightly roasted tea, steamy rather than smoky. Some bitterness on the front suggests it might be one of the more unremarkable teas.

### Steepings

#### 1st Steep (170°F / 76°C, 15s)

Definitely drinks like a light roasted tea, more steamy than smoky. Some bitterness on the front, but it seems like this might be one of the boring ones.

#### 2nd Steep (170°F / 76°C, 25s)

Nothing interesting really, some floral notes that are drowned by the light astringency.

#### 3rd Steep (170°F / 76°C, 35s)

Again, the same. I’m not going to pain myself any longer with such a boring tea.

## Overall Impression

A boring tea that’s mildly enjoyable. The subtle traits that are felt aren't ones I enjoy particularly (I really don’t like boring floral notes that always turn into bitterness).

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 10/30 – Exceptionally simple.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 10/20 – It seemed particularly sensitive around 75(± 2)°C.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 15/20 – Consistent, but its sensitivity scared me a bit.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 10/30 – Mildly enjoyable, but not to my taste.

# 45/100
