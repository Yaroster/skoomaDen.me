Preparation:

- **Temperature:** 203°F / 95°C
- **Time:** 10s, 15s, 20s, 25s, 30s, 35s (progressive infusions)
- **Tea Amount:** 5 g
- **Water Volume:** 4 oz / 120 mL

## Tasting Notes

**1st Infusion (10s):** The tea starts with a golden hue, hinting at hazelnut notes. The flavors are still finding their feet at this stage.

**2nd Infusion (15s):** The color transitions beautifully from amber to copper. This steep unveils a delightful sweetness akin to caramel candy, leaving a pleasant, lingering taste that ranks this among the best white teas I've ever tasted.

**3rd Infusion (20s):** As the tea deepens to a rich copper, it starts to lose some of its initial charm. The once prominent caramel taste shifts to the background, with a slight bitterness beginning to creep in, thankfully not yet overpowering.

**4th Infusion (25s):** With the tea cooling down, the anticipated bitterness mellows, although the sweetness begins to retreat as well.

**5th Infusion (30s):** The liquor takes on a mahogany color, with no bitterness in sight. It pleasantly returns to the caramel and hazelnut profile experienced in the second steep.

**6th Infusion (35s):** Maintaining its mahogany color, the sweetness starts to fade once again. It seems this cycle might repeat through the 11th infusion, suggesting a predictable continuation with little new to explore.

## Thoughts

2020 Nightlife by white2tea is a complex tea that offers a journey through evolving flavors, especially recommended for those curious about the nuanced transformations in high-quality white teas. Keep the brewing temperature at 95°C to avoid any undue bitterness, which this tea is prone to at lower temperatures. While it showcases moments of brilliance, particularly in the early infusions, the experience might feel cyclic and predictable as you progress through multiple steeps.

#### My recommendation: This tea is a must-try for its dynamic flavor profile but set your expectations for a gradual decline in intensity as the sessions continue.

## Rating:

- **Flavor Complexity:** 25/30 - Offers a delightful range of flavors, particularly in the early steeps.
- **Brewing Forgiveness:** 15/20 - Can become bitter if brewed incorrectly, but generally performs well with proper care.
- **Consistency Across Infusions:** 15/20 - The flavors evolve but maintain a coherent profile.
- **Overall Enjoyment:** 20/30 - Highly enjoyable in initial infusions, but becomes predictable and less exciting.
