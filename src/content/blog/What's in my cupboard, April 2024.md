## Introduction

What a month!

I had the opportunity to try a lot of new teas, and I'm excited to share my thoughts with you.

This month, I drank exclusively Palais des Thés teas, and I was not disappointed.
It was all drank in my new Gaiwan !

## The teas


- Thé du Hammam:
A fruity blend which evokes the fragrances used to perfume the hammam: roses, green dates, red fruit and orange flower water. A tea I've been trying to get my hands on for a while !

- Thé des Moines:
A Flowery tea blend inspired by a secret Tibetan recipe.
An ancient legend tells of how the Tibetan monks would prepare this blend of tea, plants and flowers in the greatest of secrecy. After several days of soaking, the leaves were carefully plucked out and put to one side.

- Thé des Lords:
A wonderful Earl Grey with a pronounced bergamot flavor, enhanced with safflower petals.

- Grand Yunnan Impérial:
The subtle flavor of this flowery, mild tea is known as the “Mocha of teas” or “Surgeon’s tea”, as it has the power to revive without over-stimulating the nerves. A splendid leaf with plenty of golden buds.

- Grand Jasmin Mao Feng:
A very rare jasmine tea composed almost entirely of tips. This tea disappeared for a long time before the Fujian province began producing it again in very small quantities.

- Pu Erh Li Cang BIO:
A simple yet potent young Pu'erh, great tea to start the notoriously strong and earty tea type.

- Bai Mu Dan:
Chinese for "White peony", it is a very fine tea, made up of all sorts of leaves in their natural state: silvery buds, Souchong leaves, first and second leaves and stems.

- Sencha Ariake:
Produced in the province of Kyushu, Sencha Ariake is the mildest of the great Sencha teas. A lot of apprehension for that one, the vegetable-ness of Japanese teas always challenged me.

- Fleur de Sureau et Pêche Bio:
A very humble peach flavored elderflower tea, smells very alcohol-y. Cannot wait to try this one out.
